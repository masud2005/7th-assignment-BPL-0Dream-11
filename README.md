## Description
BPL-Dream11-BD web application is an interactive platform that lets users build a custom sports team by selecting players from a roster while managing their budget and tracking their team composition. Each time a player is chosen, an alert popup confirms the addition to the team, providing clear feedback for the user. Double-clicking a player brings up a detailed popup with the player’s information, helping users make informed selections. Alerts are also displayed for actions like deleting a player or attempting to select a player already in the team, ensuring users are informed of all actions and budget limits as they create their ideal squad.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** for building a dynamic user interface.
- **React Toastify** for providing user notifications and alerts.
- **HTML (via JSX)** to structure and organize the app’s UI within React components.
- **CSS and Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and styling, creating a visually appealing and mobile-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for implementing the app's logic, such as player selection, budget management, and UI interactions.

## Key Features
- **Player Selection**: Allows users to choose players within a set budget, providing feedback if a player is already selected or if the selection limit is reached.
- **Budget Management**: Tracks the user's available balance, updates on player selection, and prevents overdraft.
- **Interactive UI with Notifications**: Real-time notifications alert users of actions, like successful player addition, errors on re-selection, and balance issues.
